      <h2>Description of me:</h2>
      <p> I'm a 15 year old girl struggling to survive in the real world. I suffer from depression and many many more mental illnesses. 
      I cut and I starve myself and I just wish someone was there to help me get through all of this pain that I feel. Sometimes I just feel
      that killing myself is the best thing for everyone. This is a secret page where I can express how I feel and find people who can relate
      to me. I made this page so that people like me could have a safe space to express how they feel and find a few friends who can help you.
      I will try my best to make sure no one gets judged or rideculed. if you ever need to talk to me contact me at my email and my social
      media.</p>
